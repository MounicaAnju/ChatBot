SARASOTA-MANATEE CAMPUS
The Sarasota-Manatee campus of the Muma College of Business offers all of the advantages of a world-class business school in a personalized setting.  On-campus classes are small, professors will know students by name, and students receive the individualized attention they deserve.  Perhaps one business student said it best: attending class on this campus feels like a private-school education at a public-school cost.
