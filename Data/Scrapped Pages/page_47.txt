BUILD YOUR RESUME - GET BLOOMBERG CERTIFIED
Students can earn certification from Bloomberg by completing the Bloomberg Market Concepts (BMC) courses. The program is an eight hour self-paced e-learning course that provides a visual introduction to the financial markets. BMC consists of four modules – Economics, Currencies, Fixed Income and Equities – woven together from Bloomberg data, news, analytics and television. By taking BMC, learners familiarize themselves with the industry standard service through four heavily interconnected modules. There is no cost to students completing the certification using the Bloomberg terminals. Any students completing the certification should include it on their resume.
If you are interested in becoming Bloomberg certified, please email the Director of the Bloomberg Lab.
