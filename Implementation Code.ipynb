Course Policies on Grades \\n \\nGrades of Incomplete: \\nThe current university policy concerning incomp lete grades will be followed in this course. \\nIncomp lete grades are given only in situations where unexpected emergencies prevent a stud ent from comp leting the course and the remaining work can be comp leted the nex t \\nsemester. Your instructor is the final autho rity on whether you qualify for an incomp lete. \\nIncomp lete work must  be finished by the end of the subs equent semester or the “I” will \\nautom atically be recorded as an “F” on your transcript. \\nXIV. Course Policies on Student Expectations  \\n \\n \\nNetiquette Guidelines: \\nGeneral Comm unication Guidelines \\n \\n \\n1. Act professionally in the way you comm unicate. Treat your instructors and peers with respect, \\nthe same way you would do on a face -to-face environment. Respect other people’s ideas and be \\nconst ructive when explaining your views about  points you may not agree \\nwith. \\n \\n \\n2. Be sensitive. Be respectful and sensitive when sharing your ideas and opinions. There will be \\npeople in your class with different linguistic background s, political and religious beliefs or other \\ngeneral differences. \\n \\n3. Proofread and check spelling. Doing this before sending an e mail or post ing a thread on a \\ndiscussion board will allow you to make sure your message is clear and thou ghtful. Avoid the use \\nof all capital letters, it can be perceived as if you are shout ing, and it is more difficult to read. \\n \\n4. Keep your comm unications focused and stay on  topic. Comp lete your ideas before changing the \\nsubject. By keeping the m essage on focus you allow the readers to easily get your idea or \\nanswers they are looking for. \\n \\n5. Be clear with your message. Avoid using humor  or sarcasm. Since people can’t see your \\nexpressions or hear your tone  of voice, meaning can be misinterpreted. \\n \\n \\nEmail Guidelines: \\n \\n1. Please allow 24 hours for a response  M-F or 48 hour  response  on weekends and holidays. If I am \\nnot able to get an answer to you within that timeframe, I will at least acknowledge your email. \\nThat said – if you do not hear from me within 24 hours/48 hours please feel free to contact me a \\nsecond time. \\n2. All emails to have the  course ID, Semester Offered as well as som ething to summ arize the \\ncontent. Example: MAN6055 F2018 – Grade review or MAN6055 F2018 – Exam concern \\n3. Any personal, course or confidential issues shou ld be directly comm unicated to the instructor \\nvia email. The discussion boards are public spaces; therefore any issues shou ld not be posted \\nthere. \\n \\nXV. Help Resources \\n \\n \\nCanvas Technical Support: Include information where stud ents can find technical suppo rt. \\nExample: If you have technical difficulties in canvas, you can find access to the canvas guides and \\nvideo resources in the “Canvas Help” page in the hom epage of your canvas course. You can also \\ncontact the help desk by calling 813-974-1222 in Tampa, or emailing help@usf.edu. \\n \\n \\n University Polices  \\n  \\n2021  Fall COVID -19 Mitigation  Expectations  \\nAll students  and instructors  are expected  to wear  face coverings,  at all times,  during  in-\\nperson  classes.  Per guidance from the CDC and Board of Governors,  we expect  that all \\nmembers  of our community  will wear  a mask  on campus,  vaccinated  or unvaccinated.  This \\nis especially important while indoors, in crowded outdoor settings, if you have a weakened \\nimmune system or an underlying medical c ondition. Masks will be made available to anyone who \\nneeds one.  \\nUSF strongly  urges  all community  members  to get fully vaccinated.  Vaccines are our most \\nreliable means of preventing the spread of COVID -19. The vaccine is free, readily available, and \\nall of USF’s faculty, staff, and students are of age to be eligible for the vaccine; therefore, if \\nsomeone chooses not to be vaccinated, they are assuming significant risk, including isolation and \\nquarantine. Vaccines are also the most reliable way to ensure t hat students do not face any \\ndisruption to their studies or social activities, and faculty and staff do not face disruption to their \\nteaching, research, or university work.  \\nIt is critically important that individuals who feel unwell stay home and contact S tudent Health \\nServices or their primary care provider for medical advice. Report all possible exposures \\nto assessCOVID@usf.edu . \\nStudents  in in-person  classes  may be assigned  to the same  seat for the durat ion of the Fall \\nsemester.  This can assist with exposure assessments should they be necessary.   \\nA student  who will be absent  from  an in-person  class  (due  to isolation,  quarantine  or other  \\nreason)  must  notify  the instructor  immediately  for guidance  on academ ic continuity  and \\nstudent  learning.  \\nInstructors  may schedule  remote  office  hours  during  the Fall 2021  semester.  \\nIn-person  classes  may be asked  (by USF leadership  or the COVID -19 team)  to transition  to \\ntemporary  remote  instruction  at any point  in the Fall semester.  \\n \\nAcademic  Integrity  \\nAcademic integrity is the foundation of the University of South Florida’s commitment to the \\nacademic honesty and personal integrity of its university community. Academic integrity is \\ngrounded in certain fundamental values, which include honesty, respect, and fairness. Broadly \\ndefined, academic honesty is the completion of all academic endeavors and claims of scholarly \\nknowledge as representative of one’s own efforts. The process for faculty reporting of academic \\nmisconduct, as well as the student’s options for appeal, are outlined in detail in  USF Regulation  \\n3.027 . \\n \\nAcademic  Grievance  Procedure  \\nThe purpose of these procedures is to provide all und ergraduate and graduate students taking \\ncourses  at the University of South Florida an opportunity for objective review of facts and events \\npertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. An “academic grievance” is a claim that a \\nspecific academic decisio n or action that affects that student’s academic record or status has \\nviolated published policies and procedures,  or has been applied to the grievant in a manner \\ndifferent from that used for other students.  \\n \\nDisability  Access  \\nStudents with disabilities are  responsible for registering with Students Accessibility  Services \\n(SAS) (SVC 1133) in order to receive academic accommodations. SAS encourages students to \\nnotify instructors of accommodation needs at least five (5) business days prior to needing the \\naccomm odation. A letter from SAS must accompany this request. Please visit \\nthe Student  Accessibility  Services  website  for more information.  \\n \\nDisruption  to Academic  Progress  Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the educational process. Disruption of the \\nacademic process ( USF Regulation  3.025 ) is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a \\nstudent in a classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the \\ninstructor: (a) directs attention away from the academic matters at hand, such as noisy \\ndistractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interrupt ion of lecture, exam, academic \\ndiscussion, or general University operations, or (b) presents a danger to the health, safety, or well -\\nbeing of self or other persons.  \\n \\nFood  and Housing  Insecurity  \\nWe recognize that student facing financial difficulty in secur ing a stable place to live and/or in \\naffording sufficient groceries may be at risk of these financial issues affecting their performance in \\nclasses. Students with these needs are urged to contact Feed -A-Bull \\n(feedabull@usf.edu  or their  website ), or Student Outreach and Support \\n(socat@usf.edu  or their  website ).  \\n \\nIntellectual  Freedom  and Viewpoint  Diversity  Act (House  Bill 233)  \\nPreliminary  Guidance  Document  \\nStudents may, without prior notice, record video or audio of a class lecture for a class in which the \\nstudent is enrolled for thei r own personal, educational use. A class lecture is defined as a formal \\nor methodical oral presentation as part of a university course intended to present information or \\nteach enrolled students about a particular subject. Recording class activities other t han class \\nlectures, including but not limited to lab sessions, student presentations (whether individually or \\npart of a group), class discussion, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic \\nexercises involving student participation, test or ex amination administrations, field trips, private \\nconversations between students in the class or between a student and the faculty member is \\nprohibited. Recordings may not be used as a substitute for class participation and class \\nattendance and may not be pu blished or shared without the written consent of the faculty \\nmember. Failure to adhere to these requirements may constitute a violation of the  USF Student  \\nConduct  Code .  \\n \\nReligious  Observances  \\nAll students have a right to expect that the University will reasonably accommodate their religious \\nobservances, practices and beliefs ( USF Policy  10-045). The University of South Florida, through \\nits faculty, will make every attempt to schedule required classes and examinations in view of \\ncustomarily observed religious holidays of those religious groups or communities comprising \\nUSF’s constituency. Students are expected to at tend classes and take examinations as \\ndetermined by the university. No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an \\nexamination at a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief. However, students should \\nreview the course requirements and meeting days and times to avoid foreseeable conflicts, as \\nexcessive absences in a given term may prevent a student from completing the academic \\nrequirements of a specific course. Students are expected to notify their instructors at the \\nbeginning of eac h academic term if they intend to be absent for a class or announced \\nexamination, in accordance with this Policy.  \\n \\nSexual  Misconduct  / Sexual  Harassment  \\nUSF is committed to providing an environment free from sex discrimination, including sexual \\nharassment and sexual violence ( USF Policy  0-004). The USF Center for Victim Advocacy is a \\nconfidential resource where you can talk about incidents of sexual harassment and gender -based \\ncrimes inclu ding sexual assault, stalking, and domestic/relationship violence. This confidential \\nresource can help you without having to report your situation to the  Title IX Office unless you \\nrequest that they make a report. Contact the USF  Center  for Victim  Advocacy : 813 -974-5757. \\nPlease be aware that in compliance with Title IX and under the USF Policy, educators must report \\nincidents of sexual harassment and gender -based crimes includi ng sexual assault, stalking, and domestic/relationship violence. If you disclose any of these situations personally to an educator, \\nhe or she is required to report it to the Title IX Office. For more information about Title IX, a full list \\nof resources, or  to report incidents of sexual harassment, sexual violence, relationship violence or \\nstalking visit:  usf.edu/title -ix \\n \\nStatement  of Academic  Continuity  \\nIn the event of an emergency, it may be necessary for USF to suspend normal operations. During \\nthis time, USF may opt to continue delivery of instruction through methods that include, but are \\nnot limited to: Canvas, Teams, email messaging, and/or an alternate schedule. It is the \\nresponsibility o f the student to monitor the Canvas for each class for course -specific \\ncommunication, and the USF, College, and Department websites, emails, \\nand ALERTUSF  messages for important general information ( USF Policy  6-010). \\n \\n \\nXVI. Class  Recording  \\nClasses  will be recorded  and streamed  online.  Student’s  voice and video  will be included  in the \\nclass recording.  It is the student’s  responsibility  to make  sure the privacy  of their surroundings  \\nand background  is maintained.  \\n \\n \\nXVII. Online  Proctoring  \\nQuizzes  and examinations  will be conducted  using  online  proctoring  tools.  Keeping  the audio  and \\nvideo  (microphone  and camera)  on during  such exams  and quizzes  is a must.  If the student  is not \\nwilling  to use these,  the student  is asked  not to register  for this course.  Any student  may elect to \\ndrop or withdraw  from this course  before  the end of the drop/add  period.  Online  exams  and \\nquizzes  within  this course  may require  online  proctoring.  Therefore,  students  will be required  to \\nhave a webcam  (USB or internal)  with a microphone  when  taking  an exam  or quiz. Students  \\nunderstand  that this remote  recording  device  is purchased  and controlled  by the student  and that \\nrecordings  from any private  residence  must be done with the permission  of any person  residing  in \\nthe residence.  To avoid  any concerns  in this regard,  students  should  select  private  spaces  for the \\ntesting.  The University  library  and other academic  sites at the University  offer secure  private  \\nsettings  for recordings,  and students  with concerns  may discuss  the location  of an appropriate  \\nspace  for the recordings  with their instructor  or advisor.  Students  must ensure  that any \\nrecordings  do not invade  any third-party privacy  rights  and accept  all responsibility  and liability  for \\nviolations  of any third-party privacy concerns.  Setup  information  will be provided  prior to taking  \\nthe proctored  exam.  For additional  information  about  online  proctoring  you can visit the online  \\nproctoring  student  FAQ at http://www.usf.edu/innovative -education/resources/student -\\nservices/online -proctoring.aspx  \\n \\n \\n '})"

Campus Free Expression: It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussio n of ideas that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive. In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the ide a(s) presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is supported by credible research. Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it.

It is the responsibility of the student to monitor the Learning Management System for each class for course -specific communication, and the main USF, College, and Department websites, emails, and MoBull messages for important general information (USF Policy 6 -010). For additional guidance on emergency protective actions and hazards that affect the University, please visit www.usf.edu/em 12 XXII. Course Policies: Grades Late Work Policy : Make -ups for exams are at the discretion of the professor and require appropriate documentation. Other than providing documentation for an emergency situation, all make -up exams requests require advance notice. Further, the burden of proof for a make -up falls on the student. Do not request a make -up exam without appropriate documentation. All other assignments (not including extra credit) turned in late will be assessed a 25% penalty if within 59 minutes of the deadline. If between 1 hour and 24 hours late, a 50% penalty will be assessed. After 24 hours late no work will be accepted for credit. The s ubmission times recorded in Canvas will be utilized for all late work penalties. If you have Canvas issues and the deadline is close, you should email your completed work immediately and then finish your submission process. I will only grade papers submitt ed through Canvas. The email will only serve to demonstrate you attempted to submit your work on time. Extra Credit Policy : An extra credit opportunity may be provided. If so, all students will have an equal opportunity to earn the same level of extra credit as all other student regardless of the pre-existing grade in the class. No late submissions are allowed with regards to extra credit. Grades of \"Incomplete\": An Incomplete grade (\"I\") is exceptional and granted at the instructor’s discretion only when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other circumstances beyond their control. The course instructor and student must complete and sign the \"I\" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long as it does not exceed two semesters for undergraduate courses and one semester for graduate courses from the original date grades were due for that course. An \"I\" grade not cleared within the two semesters for undergraduate courses and one semester for graduate courses (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contract. Rewrite Policy : Students have the opportunity to get feedback before assignments are turned in for a grade. Thus, no rewrites for a')]"
